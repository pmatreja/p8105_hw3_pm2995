Problem 1.1
-----------

Loading the data and some cleaning

First we load the BRFSS data from the `p8105.datasets` package.

``` r
data(brfss_smart2010)
```

Next, we do some cleaning to ensure appropriate variable names. I cleaned the data using janitor:: clean\_names function converting them all to lower snake case, filter to include only overall health topic data and include responses from excellent to poor. Further, I organized the responses as a factor taking levels ordered from excellent to poor using mutate.

``` r
brfss_tidy = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  rename(location_abbr = locationabbr, location_desc = locationdesc) %>%
  mutate(response = as.factor(response)) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = fct_relevel(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
    )
```
