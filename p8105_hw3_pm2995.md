Problem 1
=========

Problem 1.1
-----------

Loading the data and some cleaning

First we load the BRFSS data from the `p8105.datasets` package.

``` r
data(brfss_smart2010)
```

Next, we do some cleaning to ensure appropriate variable names. I cleaned the data using janitor:: clean\_names function converting them all to lower snake case, filter to include only overall health topic data and include responses from excellent to poor. Further, I organized the responses as a factor taking levels ordered from excellent to poor using mutate.

``` r
brfss_tidy = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  rename(location_abbr = locationabbr, location_desc = locationdesc) %>%
  mutate(response = as.factor(response)) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = fct_relevel(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
    )
```

Specific Questions

Problem 1.2
-----------

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

Answer: The code chunk below filters to include the rows from year 2002 and groups the data by location\_abbr (which includes states). Further, using summarize number of distinct locations in each state has been taken out. I have used filter to keep states that were observed at 7 locations.

``` r
brfss_tidy %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(location_abbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n_distinct(location_desc)) %>% 
  filter(n_locations == 7)
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   location_abbr n_locations
##   <chr>               <int>
## 1 CT                      7
## 2 FL                      7
## 3 NC                      7
```

Three states were observed at seven locations: CT, FL, and NC.

Problem 1.3
-----------

Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

Answer: The code below groups the brfss\_tidy data by location\_abbr(state) and year and further uses summarize to take out the number of corresponding observations. It then creates a spaghetti plot that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

``` r
brfss_tidy %>% 
  group_by(location_abbr, year) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n_obs, color = location_abbr)) +
  geom_line() + labs(title = "No. of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010", x = "Year", y = "Number of observations") + theme(legend.position = "right")
```

There is a lot of clumping in this plot and peaks can be seen for the state of Florida for the year 2007 and 2010. Also, it can be seen that for NJ there were consistent number of locations from 2005 to 2006 and then from 2009 to 2010.

Problem 1.4
===========

Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

Answer: The code below filters to keep the rows for the years 2002,2006 and 2010, Excellent response and for NY state. Further, it uses group\_by function to group by the year and summarize to compute mean and standard deviations of for those years. The result is presented in the form of a table using knitr::kable.

``` r
brfss_tidy %>%
  filter(year %in% c("2002", "2006", "2010")) %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  filter(location_abbr == "NY") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_excellent = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE), sd_excellent = sd(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

|  year|  mean\_excellent|  sd\_excellent|
|-----:|----------------:|--------------:|
|  2002|             24.0|            4.5|
|  2006|             22.5|            4.0|
|  2010|             22.7|            3.6|

There is not much difference in the mean proportion for the excellent response for the years 2006 and 2010, whereas the mean proportion for the excellent response is a bit different in the year 2002.

Problem 1.5
===========

For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.

Answer: The code below makes a five panel plot that shows the distribution of state level averages over time for each response category separately. To compute the average proportion in each category for each year and state, I have grouped the data by year, location\_abbr(state) and response and further made the five panel plot by using facet grid to separate out each response category.

``` r
brfss_tidy %>% 
  group_by(year,location_abbr,response) %>% 
  summarize(average = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = average, color = response)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(~ response) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of State Level Averages Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Mean Proportions") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_pm2995_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

The distribution of state level averages over time suggest that the response "very good" was observed the most over the years and the response "poor" was observed the least.

Problem 2
=========

Loading the dataset

Let's load the data from the `p8105.datasets` package.

``` r
data("instacart")
```
